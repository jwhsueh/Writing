# From the other side
# Gemini

When dawn ends your nightmare
Can you feel
Call from the morning star

When I still remember
Leave a kiss
Tides will erase it soon

Why is it
People live in silence
With a smile like it is always good to be
Tell me how to break it
From the other side to save your hollow dreams
Knowing there is one day
The tears you shed won’t be in vain
Will you trust me once again

Dream it 
Until dawn ends nightmare
You’ll come back to me
What if I
Dream too hard and get blinded
I can give up everything 
Let you know one thing
There is someone waiting for another chance
Hold you once again

I wish I could stop it
Hear it tick
Time flies without a sign

Why is it
Words of madness
Whisper to my ears
Don’t let them break in
Cling to my sanity
There is one day the blood I shed won’t be in vain
Will I wake up once again

Dream it 
Until dawn ends nightmare 
You’ll come back to me
What if I
Dream too hard and get blinded
You shall go through everything even without me
There’s no one echoing your sorrow
I wish I can

Till dawn ends your nightmare

Nothing would change but there’s no room for me
Open your eyes and I pray you will notice
How could story just end here and shatter my dream
Even if I had tried so many times
Remember
Nothing but a hope to believe
Reach me when
Whole world falls into darkness
From the other side
