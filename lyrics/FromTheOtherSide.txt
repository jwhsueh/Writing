# From the other side

Till dawn ends the nightmare
Till you sleep
Wish I make it through

When I still remember
Leave a kiss
Tides will erase it soon

Can’t you see
People live in silence
Like a curse but they don’t feel anything
Don’t know how to break it
From the other side to save your hollow dreams
Tell you there’s one day
The tears you shed won’t be in vain
Could you trust me once again...

Be with me
Till dawn ends nightmare whenever you try
**To break pri-son of fate
I’ll set you free
I would give up everything 
Let you know one thing
There is someone waiting for another chance
Embrace you once again

I wish I could stop it
Hear it tick
Time's not on my side

Can’t you see
World of madness
Like a fire of beast
**No one fights to it
**Faith has become ashes
**I don’t believe the blood I shed all be in vain
**Please wake up once again

Be with me
Till dawn ends nightmare and leave you a kiss
**And embrace my tales of fate that set me free
You can go through everything even without me
There’s no one echoing your sorrow
I wish I can

Till dawn ends the nightmare

I was a lamb when the story begins
You are the light of my life so set me free
**How to break this endless loop
I’ll try once again
**No matter how hard and how many times
I’ll leave you
Nothing but a hope to believe (proceed?)
I’ll meet you
When this world falls in darkness
From the other side
